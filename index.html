		<h1>Choosing RC4's next CSC IT head</h1>
		<section>
			<p>Thank you for your interest in taking up this job. The document here shares some information you'll want to know regarding the application process (which is extremely simple) as well as the actual role itself.</p>
			<p>First, please note that this process is separate from the rest of CSC or House Head campaigning. The next CSC IT head is selected <em>internally</em>, and there are no voting shenanigans involved.</p>

				<li>After everyone has been interviewed, I will make a decision and let you know the results.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The meeting aims to check your level of technical know-how as well as enthusiasm for the role. At the same time, I hope it can be used to clear any doubts you may have regarding CSC IT. For the first half of the meeting, I will ask you to share about a project you have worked on, or some piece of tech you have learned, or anything else related to tech.<label for="sn-meeting-questions" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-meeting-questions" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">For example, you can choose to share about your experience learning HotNewLanguage69.</span> In the second half, we can discuss administrative things.</p>
			<p>In total, the meeting should take no more than an hour.</p>

			<h2>FAQs</h2>
			<p>Actually, these aren't frequently asked lol. In fact, nobody asked them. But I'll list them here because it is helpful info.</p>
			<h3>How much work is involved?</h3>
			<p>This is completely up to you. The main role of CSC IT is to support the other committees with whatever tech initiatives they hope to have. Thus, it would be up to you to reject or accept any proposals. If you reject everything, then there is nothing to do. If you say yes to everything, then there might be too many things to do.</p>
			<p>At the start of the next AY, decide on how many projects you want to have. For this year, we tried to have  three projects - ZvH, laundry, and miscellaneous bots. In hindsight, I should have been more focused.</p>
			<h3>Do I need to prepare anything for the meeting?</h3>
			<p>Just decide on something you want to share. There should be no need for any further preparation, and it is better if we have an organic conversation.</p>
			<h3>What about the vice-head?</h3>
			<p>The next CSC IT head will choose someone to be their vice-head. This person does not need to be in CSC IT currently, so you can feel free to pick someone you work well with. If you think you work better alone, then it is okay to not pick a vice-head also.</p>
			<h3>Why is it "IT head" and not "IT Director"?</h3>
			<p>Yeah so it seems they wish to reserve the "Director" title for the folks who are actually elected by the college. There is a chance for some re-organization of CSC for the next AY where the IT head takes a slightly less prominent role. Just speculating, nothing is confirmed yet.</p>
			<h3>What happens if I am not selected?</h3>
			<p>If I end up not selecting you, please note that it does not necessarily mean that you are not qualified. Most likely there was someone else whom I felt was better suited for the job. For your info, I hate having conduct this process too, and personally believe that anyone can do this job well as long as they have the interest and commitment.</p>
			<p>But at the end of the day, I need to pick someone, so bopian ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I hope you will continue to support CSC IT.</p>
			<h3>What are the perks of being IT head?</h3>
			<p>You get to</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gain some points for SR.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Jokes aside, I do think my experience was worth the time. I learned a valuable lesson that if I change the SSH port, I also need to enable listening on that port before logging out.</p>
			<p>Working with the rest of CSC is pretty cool as well. They're all quite friendly, and you can make some new friends.</p>
			<h3>Uh, I still have questions?</h3>
			<p>Feel free to contact me on Telegram!</p>
